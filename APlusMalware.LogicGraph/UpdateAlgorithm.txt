2. Set node inputs with external input values

While there exists at least one non-updated, partially or fully set node
3. For each node n with all inputs set, update n
4. Update one partially set node




Update node
1. Mark as updated
2. Update the internal state based upon inputs
3. Set the inputs of each out-node o
  a. If all inputs of o are set, add o to all inputs set queue
